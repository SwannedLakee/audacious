These SVG files are based on the Paper Icon Set with slightly different colors
(https://github.com/snwh/paper-icon-theme/tree/master/Paper/scalable).
The light icons use "#555", the dark ones "#ccc" for the "fill" attribute.

They have been optimized with "svgo" (https://github.com/svg/svgo)
and then un-optimized as shown below to work around the following librsvg bug:
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=620923

Basically, older versions of librsvg can't parse an optimized path like
".123.456", they need it spelled out as "0.123 0.456".

An SVG file can be un-optimized by the following regex replacements:

Replace once:
    ([^0-9])\.
    \10\.

Replace until no longer found:
    ([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)\.([0-9|\.|-]+)
    \1\.\2 0\.\3

Replace once:
    www0
    www
